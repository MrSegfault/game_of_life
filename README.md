# game_of_life
Conway's game of life implemented in C.

This is a terminal-oriented implementation, I wanted to be able to use it as some sort of screensaver for when I am working with a command-line interface.

In order to execute it you should provide two arguments (the number of rows and the number of columns for the matrix).
